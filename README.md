## Project description

In terms of the current project, a custom design of the Landing page using Next.js for Front-end was developed. The design was complicated with animations that were done by using framer motion. The Admin panel with multi-languages was developed on Laravel.
The pancake.finance API was integrated for Swap, Stake, LP and Farming functionality. Metamask serves as a Login and allows user make operations in Binance Smart Chain Network with BEP-20 and ERC-72 protocols. The Smart contracts for the custom token and for operations with it were developed.
The Graph from the Pancake platform wasnâ€™t allowed to parse thus we integrated Proxy server with Redis cashing.
